just doing the homework :-) </br>

now, I am trying to send a pull request. I still don't fully understand when I send a pull request...it is after a commit, right? Let's see. </br>

Hmm...I pushed without creating a pull request. Is it because I worked directly from master? Ok, let's make a branch.
